Emergency-Service-Directory
===========================

A jquery project to create the front-end for already existing back-end


Project Requirements:
=====================

Write search functionality to obtain a specific organization, once that is obtained you will ask the RESTful service for the pertinent data

all functionality is handled by jQuery

Dynamic creation, animation, form validation, browser detection and redirection – all done the ‘jQuery’ way.

The WADL (Web Application Description Language (XML)) for the services is available at: http://simon.ist.rit.edu:8080/Services/resources/application.wadl

Professional graphics

Use of AJAX to pull in your data (from XML supplied from the RESTful service) using a proxy server (already provided)

The use of at least 3 plug-ins that extend jQuery that add to your project. 

Provide a map interface using a google maps in the ‘Locations’ tab (NOT included in the 3 plugins above) – will officially make this application a mashup!
